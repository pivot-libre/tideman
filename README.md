## Purpose
This algorithm takes a collection of rankings and produces a reasonably fair aggregate ranking using T.N. Tideman's Ranked Pairs Algorithm.

## Background
This documentation's intended audience is programmers. See [Wikipedia's Ranked Pairs article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs) or Canadian MP Ron McKinnon's [condorcet.ca](https://condorcet.ca) for layperson-oriented explanations. 

## Summary
This algorithm first computes the difference in popular support between all pairs of candidates across all ballots. This pairwise difference between two candidates is called a margin. Next, the algorithm sorts the margins in order of descending difference. The algorithm then builds a graph data structure by iterating through the sorted list of margins from largest difference to smallest difference, adding an edge that points from the winning candidate to the losing candidate of each margin. If adding a margin's edge would introduce a cycle, the margin is ignored. The winning candidate is the candidate who has no edges pointing at them once the graph has been completed. In other words, the winner is the [source node](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Source.html) in the completed graph. If multiple winners are desired, then the entire algorithm is repeated without considering candidates that have already won.

## Usage
Add `pivot-libre/tideman` as a dependency in your project's composer.json.
See [tests/RankedPairsCalculatorTest.php](tests/RankedPairsCalculatorTest.php) for example usage.

 * Independence of Clones as a Criterion for Voting Rules. Tideman, T.N. Soc Choice Welfare (1987) 4: 185. [https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00433944](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00433944)
 * Complete Independence of Clones in the Ranked Pairs Rule. Zavist, T.M. & Tideman, T.N. Soc Choice Welfare (1989) 6: 167. [https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00303170](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00303170)

The original 1987 Ranked Pairs paper lacked a tie-breaking rule. The follow-up 1989 paper added a tie-breaking rule.

### Pairwise Tie-Breaking
When ranking pairs of candidates, it is possible that the difference in popular support between two candidates is equal to the difference in popular support between two other candidates. In that case, the tie between the pairs of candidates must be broken by a pairwise tie-breaking rule. This library breaks pairwise ties according to a user-specified tie-breaking Ballot object. If the user of the library specifies a tie-breaking Ballot object that contains ties within it (i.e. ties between candidates), the library breaks all of that Ballot object's ties using [PHP's default random number generator](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php). The library does not enforce the source of the tie-breaking Ballot object. If a user wished to follow the tie-breaking rule specified in Zavist, Tideman 1989, they should randomly select a Ballot object from among those submitted by the electorate, and use it as the tie-breaking Ballot object.

## Contributing
### Setup
 * Install PHP 7.1 and composer.
 * The library is known to work when the following PHP extensions are installed, though the minimal list of extensions is probably shorter (See [Issue #51](https://github.com/pivot-libre/tideman/issues/51)): ctype,curl,dom,iconv,json,mbstring,openssl,pdo,pdo_sqlite,phar,sqlite3,tokenizer,xmlreader,xmlwriter,zlib
### Working With the Code
 * Fork this repo.
 * Clone your fork.
 * Add this repo as upstream.
     * Examples:
         * `git remote add upstream git@github.com:pivot-libre/tideman.git`
         * `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pivot-libre/tideman.git`
 * Download the dependencies
     * `composer install`
 * Build the project
     * `vendor/bin/phing`
     * This command checks the syntax of the files, run tests, checks for formatting conformance, and performs static code quality analysis.
 * At the end of the output you should see `BUILD FINISHED`. You should not see `BUILD FAILLED`.
 
### Visualizing Test Coverage
 * Make sure you have [installed xdebug](https://xdebug.org/docs/install).
 * Run
 * `vendor/bin/phing coverage`
 * Open a web browser to `file:///<file-path-to-cloned-repo>tideman/build/coverage/index.html`
 * For example: `file:///home/john_doe/src/tideman/build/coverage/index.html`

### Sharing Your Work
 * Git `add`, and `commit` your local changes
 * Push your changes to your GitHub fork
     * `git push origin`
 * Create a pull request between your fork and the PivotLibre/tideman repo.
 
### Getting Updates
 * `git fetch upstream`
 * Depending on whether you are using a merge-based or rebase-based workflow you will run one of:
     * `git merge upstream/0.x`
     * `git rebase upstream/0.x`
